This file uses the following analytic dataset to address several researches
questions regarding education levels in the USA subset on County levels

Dataset Name: Education_analytic_file created in external file
STAT6250-01_w18-team-5_project1_data_preparation.sas, which is assumed to be
in the same directory as this file

See included file for dataset properties

* set relative file import path to current directory (using standard SAS trick);

'Research Question: Which county has the highest(maximum) education levels for California for the period 2011-2015?'
;

title2
'Rationale: This will provide me the maximum educational level of adults for California.'
;

footnote1
'It shows that the  maximum educational level for Bachelor Degree or higher, grouped by California for 2011-2015'
;
*
Methodology: Use IF statement to remove rows where CH2011_15 would 
represent the whole state which would mislead where the maximum should be.
Then use proc means statement to fin max for each state. 

Limitations: This methodology does not account for districts with 
missing data, nor does it attempt to validate data in any way.

Possible Follow-up Steps: Compare the max by year

'Research Question: Which is the least educated state using column Bachelor Defree or higher, 2011-2015?'

title2
'Rationale: This would help us to know the least educated state in the USA.'
;

footnote1
'Now we see the least educated state who got Bachelor''s or higher (2011-2015).'
;
*
Methodology: Compute lowest mean of State of indicator variable

Limitations: This methodology does not account for any States 
with missing data, nor does it attempt to validate data in any way.

Possible Follow-up Steps: More carefully clean the values 
of the variable Bachelordegree_higher_2011_2015 so that the 
statistics computed do not include any possible illegal values,
and better handle missing data.

'Rationale: This would help determine how California''s education level is.'

*
Methodology: Create new dataset with only CA data. 
Then plot scatter plot graph to show variable CH2011_15 by county name.

Limitations: This methodology does not account for any States 
with missing data, nor does it attempt to validate data in any way.

Possible Follow-up Steps: Expand it to other education level.
