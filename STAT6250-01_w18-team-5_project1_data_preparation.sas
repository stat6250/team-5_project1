[Data Source] The file was downloaded from an external website at
https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/Education.xls?v=42762 and was
then edited to remove the top four lines and to add better titles for column
names.

All measures related to educational attainment refer to the number of adults
who have achieved the specified level of educational attainment according
to the census year. For example, "High school diploma only, 1970" refers to
the number of adults who reported on the 1970 census that they achieved a high
school diploma and did not achieve any higher degrees.

Create a data file for Team 5 members to use for analysis questions, only
keeping columns and adding new measures that will be used by one or more
team members.

Since only county-level data will be used in analyses by Team 5, remove any
observations of non-counties (i.e. states, countries).

Permanent labels are added to each variable so that when they are shown in
HTML output, they will have a descriptive name.
